# DannyStats Quickstart

## What is DannyStats?

DannyStats is a Python module written for the UHS Math Modeling for Society club.

Statistics is hard[citation needed], or, at the very least, time-consuming to learn. That's the fundamental principle behind the creation of this module- to increase the accessibility of statistics and lower the skill barrier of entry to programming in Python.

DannyStats is designed so that you don't need to memorize the names of **every single statistical test** in order to do some basic testing on your data, nor do you have to know how to work *scary* Python modules such as SciPy or MatPlotLib in order to run tests and visualize your data.

This quickstart assumes you already know some basic Python and will be able to read the code blocks throughout the document.
